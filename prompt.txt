Comply with these program modification standards:

Modification File Format

MMM another_function MMM

arg2

Available Modification Functions

Meta Operations

MMM modification_description MMM
Text to append to the git commit message describing the purpose of the modification(s).

File Operations

create_file(file_path, file_content, make_executable=True)
move_file(src, dst)
make_directory(path)
remove_file(path, recursive=False)
update_file(path, file_content)

Code Modifications

declare(file_path, target_path [, new_code])
    Declare a function, class, or assignment in a file with code using lexical chain support.
    If the target_path exists one or more times, replace all with the new declaration.
    target_path: Use dot notation for nested items (e.g., "ClassName.method_name")
    If the optional new_code is omitted, the declaration will be deleted.

Example Modification File

MMM modification_description MMM
Fix file processing.
(with was absent and potentially problematic under failures.)
MMM declare MMM
app.py
@@@@@@
DataProcessor.process_file
@@@@@@
def process_file(self, filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        data = f.read()
    return self.transform(data)

MMM create_file MMM
run_tests.sh
@@@@@@
#!/bin/bash
python -m pytest tests/
@@@@@@
True
MMM modification_descrption MMM
Stub out unit directory for future unit tests.
Empty for now though.
MMM make_directory MMM
tests/unit

If something needs to be changed at the __main__ level other than a declaration, update the entire file.
Use consistent file names so imports continue working
Only change symbol names when function behavior changes
Don't mask failures with try/except blocks or fallbacks unless requested
Avoid superfluous modifiers like "improved", "optimized", "comprehensive"
Divide code into separate files for minimal context updates
Create subdirectories according to best practices for separation of code, data and results.
In creating subdirectories avoid circular imports!

All code modification directives are to be presented as a single code block or downloadable file.

When you have understood these standards reply with:

I understand and in particular will not multiply symbols beyond necessity.  What is my programming task?
